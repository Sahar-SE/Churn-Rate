# Churn-Rate
This repository query data of a website with SQL and calculate its **Churn Rate**.

## The churn rate refers to the percentage of customers who discontinue using a company's services or products within a specific time frame. This rate is typically used to assess customer loyalty and the overall performance of a business.

To calculate the churn rate, the following formula is usually applied:

## Churn Rate = ( Number of Customers Lost / Total Customers at the Start of the Period ) × 100
## Churn Rate=( Total Customers at the Start of the Period /Number of Customers Lost ) × 100
For example, if a company starts the month with 1,000 customers and loses 50 customers by the end of that month, the churn rate would be calculated as follows:

```Churn Rate = ( people who canceled=50 / people who enrolled=1000 ) × 100 = 5% ```
A high churn rate may indicate issues with service quality, pricing, or competition, and companies typically strive to reduce this rate to retain more customers.
